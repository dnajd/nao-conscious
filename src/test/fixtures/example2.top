u: ("chapter 2") %chap2 Your mission is to open relations with the simple Bandi people who have tapped a immense energy source and used it to construct Farpoint Station. An omnipotent being appears and identifies himself as the Q. He demands you head home.

u: ("chapter 3") %chap3 The Q warns you that your mission is destined to fail and then leaves.  The Enterprise arrives at Deneb 4 and the crew is suspicious of how certain items they desire appear out of nowhere.

u: ("chapter 6") %chap6 order an away team to check out the alien craft.  The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature. It occurs to you that Zorn exploited this creatures ability to synthesize matter and used it to create Farpoint Station. 
	u1: (~attack) You order the Enterprise to fire a vivifying energy beam onto Farpoint Station after it is evacuated. The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and it flies into orbit to join its fellow being. As the crew watches the reunion of the alien creatures, Q reluctantly tells you that they have succeeded in their test, but hints that he will be back
